I have been asked if I was the team admin assistant and how good of a cook I am multiple times. I have sat in meetings where nobody looked like me and walked onto site feeling like I do not belong there. I have also met some of the most ambitious and courageous people I have ever known through my female friend group in engineering - one of which is the current co-founder of my startup. I have seen what females can do when partnerships and friendships are made and I am passionate about the accomplishments being made by my female coworkers, startup founders I work with, and mentors. Although I still have a lot to learn - I think events like DEEDhacks are an AMAZING way to show STEM just how bada** females are and will be a great opportunity to form friendships that may just turn into business partnerships one day. I would love to help in any way I can!
